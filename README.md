# Vigenere-CSC7
This project is a program that uses the Vigenère Cipher to encrypt and decrypt messages. The Vigenère Cipher is a method of securely transforming text using a keyword to shift letters. Users can input a message and a keyword, and the program will either encode or decode the text based on their choice. The program is designed to be easy to use while demonstrating programming concepts like string manipulation, ascii math, and modular arithmetic.
The program starts by asking if you want to encrypt or decrypt a message. After you make your choice, it will prompt you to enter your message and a keyword. The program processes the input to create a matching key, shifts the letters using the cipher’s rules, and displays the result. All inputs are converted to uppercase to keep things simple and consistent.
